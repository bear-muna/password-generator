# Password Generator

## Description
Welcome to the 'Password Generator'. Here you'll be able to generate a random password using certain types of characters that you choose, yourself. 
This logic behind this project was mostly created within Javascript. With Javascript, I was able to create objects, functions, and prompts that the user interacts with in order to generate a password. The prompts used were a series of user text prompts and user confirmation prompts that Javascript then stores in different variables. These variables were then placed in several condition statements to determine which type of characters were going to be used for the final password.
Some problems that I have stumbled across were figuring out how to use conditional statements and how they were supposed to tie into generating a password. Another problem was trying to figure out how to create multiple arrays from strings and how to create a so-called 'master array' from multiple arrays. One approach to this was separating the characters in a string into a character array; making the arrays easier to merge using the .concat() method.
This homework challenge served to get me more familiar with Javascript and how it works. I was able to develop a deeper understanding of objects, functions, and logical arguments after completing this assignment.
